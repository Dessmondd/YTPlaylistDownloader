# Download Music from YT Music playlists.

This script was made for a friend of mine that required to download songs from his specific youtube playlist (works for youtube music too!) and save those in a folder.

Is a fair simple code in python, using pytube.

<h1>How does it work?</h1>

Basically all you gotta do is retrieve the ID of your playlist from the URL section:
![example](https://github.com/Dessmondd/YTPlaylistDownloader/assets/97458634/ea78d460-09ef-4ea5-a845-7f2c9b8b2697)

Once you have the ID just go execute ytdownloader.exe and in the console that would pop up, just paste that ID:

![example2](https://github.com/Dessmondd/YTPlaylistDownloader/assets/97458634/54a0d741-31bb-404d-8762-c8df27cf0e31)

And that's it! it will automatically create a folder called "downloads" in the same path where you executed the .exe.

Enjoy!
